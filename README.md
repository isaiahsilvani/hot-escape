# HOT ESCAPE

Hot Escape was developed with the objective of allowing users to plan their entire vacation all in 1 app! You are able to select flights, log hotels, log rental information, as well as plan attractions all within the Hot Escape app.
This app was developed in one week during our time at General Assembly as a group React project.

## App Description:

Some of the app features include: Flight search options sorting by either cost or nearest airport location. Hotel and Rental information can be logged in the app in terms of location, pricing, room number, and so on. Users can input the attractions they wish to visit. A chat room is available in which users are able to ask questions about an upcoming trip or share their thoughts on their previous experiences. 

Each user receives an Itinerary page in which they can add to or modify all the info for an upcoming vacation. For each additional vacation a user plans, a new separate itinerary page is created so multiple vacations can all be planned separately!
